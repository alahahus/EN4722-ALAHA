 A long time ago when the world was jut formed, there existed 2 Chiefs above. One- Chief Seagull, the other our Creator Latoosalagaleese whose name means “He who walks across the universe”.
<br>
<br>
Chief Seagull liked to collect things especially shiny things. After a while he had collected all the shiny things from above, like the stars, the moon and the sun. Chief Seagull put these things in huge box and put the box high up in his house so that only he could reach it. 
<br>
<br>
The world was in darkness and our Creator was not pleased. He decided that he must return the shiny things to the Universe. In order to do this he would have to use his special powers and medicine. Latoosalagleese transformed himself into a Raven and flew through the darkness to the Village of Chief Seagull. 
<br>
<br>
Raven perched himself in a tree that he had seen in the village. From this tree he could watch what was going on below in Chief Seagulls’ village. Our Creator now known as Omeelth, when he was in the form of the Raven, could see that Chief Seagull’s wife would go to the water at the same time every day. When she returned for water the following day, Omeelth  flew above her into a pine tree and transformed himself into a pine needle.
<br>
<br>
He then fell into the water and drifted into the hands of Chief Seagull’s wife who unknowingly swallowed him.  It was not long before she knew she was with child. When she told Chief Seagull, he hoped immediately for a child that would be just like himself. 
<br>
<br>
Not long after that Omeelth was born, the child of Chief Seagull…he grew quickly.
<br>
<br>
One day the child wanted to lay with the box that held all the shiny things of heaven. But…permission was not given. This made the child cry very loud and have a temper tantrum. When Chief Seagull heard this he was impatient and did not want to put up with it. He put the box down for Omeelth to play with but he warned the child not to open it. 
<br>
<br>
Then Chief Seagull went over to a corner of the house. When it was safe Creator transformed into the Raven and with is beak he grabbed the box and left the house. Once he was outside Raven jumped into a canoe and paddled away.
<br>
<br>
Before long Raven came to an island, on it he could see something moving around.  He went closer to see what it could be. When he got closer he could see that it was a tribe of women picking berries. The women saw Raven standing in the canoe with the large box and they moved closer to have a better look. Raven asked the women what they were picking, berries the women answered. Will you give me some Raven asked?
<br>
<br>
At first the women moved away, they did not want to give up any of their berries. After some discussion amongst themselves they decided to give Raven only a few.
<br>
<br>
In response Raven lifted the box cover, just enough to let out a bit of light to shine through. When the women saw the light they became excited and asked to see more.
<br>
<br>
When Raven asked for more berries, they moved back from the shoreline. They knew that this time, in order to see more of the light, they would have to give up more of their berries.
<br>
<br>
The women gave just a little more than they had before. Raven responded by lifting the lid higher, the light filled more area than it had before. The women asked Raven to lift the lid higher and offered more berries. Raven lifted the lid even higher that he had before.
<br>
<br>
The light now allowed the women to see all around them. They marveled at the beauty in which they stood. Finally the oldest of the women made her way through the crowd and stood before Raven. She looked towards the ground and said, your Greatness I have seen this before and if we could see it all, I would give you all the berries that I have.
<br>
<br>
She gave him a handful that she had managed to pick. This pleased Raven and in turn he grabbed all the shiny things of heaven from the box and with one swoop of his wings he placed them back in the universe. 
<br>
<br>
Raven Omeelth who also has the name Latoosalagaleese then went back to his village. He was pleased with the way goodness had been brought back to the world.
