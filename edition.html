<b>Enter I(J)uliet somewhat fast, and embraceth Romeo. [enter where this is taking place so the students can orient themselves]</b>

(who is speaking?):See where she comes.
So light of foote nere hurts the troden flower:
Of lou(v)e and i(j)oy, see see the soueraigne(sovereign) power.
Iul<i> (Juliet) </i>: Romeo.
Rom(Romeo): My I(J)uliet welcome. As doo waking eyes
(Cloasd (Closed) in Nights my(i)sts) attend the frolicke Day,
So Romeo hath expected I(J)uliet,
And thou art come.
Iul(Juliet): I am (if I be Day)
Come to my Sunne: shine foorth, and make me faire.
Rom <i> (Romeo) </i>(: All beauteous fairness(s) dwelleth in thine eyes.
Iul<i> (Juliet) </i>): Romeo from thine all brightnes(s) doth arise.
Fr<i> (Friar Lawrence) </i>: Come wantons, come, the stealing houres do passe
Defer i(e)mbracements till some fitter time,
Part for a while, you shall not be alone,
Till holy Church hau(v)e ioynd ye both in one.
Rom<i> (Romeo) </i>: Lead holy Father, all delay seemes long.
Iul<i> (Juliet) </i>: Make hast(e), make hast(e), this ling(e)ring doth v(u)s wrong.
Fr<i> (Friar Lawrence) </i>: O, soft and faire makes sweetest worke they say.
Hast is common hindrer in crosse way.
Exeunt omnes.
(Insert break)
Enter Benuvolio,(and) Mercutio.
Ben<i> (Benvolio) </i>: I pree thee good Mercutio lets retire,
The day is hot, the Capels are abroad.
Mer<i> (Mercutio) </i>: Thou art like one of those, that when hee comes
into the confines of a tauerne, claps me his rapier on the
boord, and sayes, God send me no need of thee: and by
the operation of the next cup of wine, he drawes it on the
drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Ben <i> (Benvolio) </i>: Am I like such a one?
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: Go too, thou art as hot a Iacke being mooude,
and as soone mooude to be moodie(y), and as soone moodie to
be mooud.
Ben <i> (Benvolio) </i>: And what too?
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: Nay, and there were two such, wee should hau(v)e
none shortly. Didst not thou fall out with a man for crack-
ing of nuts, hau(v)ing no other reason, but because thou hadst
hasill (hazel) eyes? w(W) hat eye but such an eye would hau(v)e pickt out
such a quarrell? With another for coughing, because hee
wakd thy dogge that laye a(remove space)sleepe in the Sunne ? With a
Taylor for wearing his new dublet before Easter: and
with another for tying his new shoes with olde ribands.
And yet thou wilt forbid me of quarrelling.
Ben <i> (Benvolio) </i>: By my head heere comes a Capo(u)let.
Enter Tybalt.
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: By my heele I care not.
Tyb <i> (Tybalt) </i>: Gentlemen a word with one of you.
Mer: But one word with one of v(u)s? You had best couple
it with somewhat,and make it a word and a blow.
Tyb <i> (Tybalt) </i>: I am apt enough to that if I have occasion.
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: Could you not take occasion?
Tyb <i> (Tybalt) </i>: Mercutio thou consorts with Romeo?
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: Consort(?) Zwounes (Zounds!) c(C)onsort? the slave wil make fid-
lers of v(u)s. If you doe sirra, look for nothing but discord: For
heere(‘)s my fiddle-sticke.
<b>Enter Romeo</b>.
Tyb <i> (Tybalt) </i>: Well(,) peace be with you, heere comes my man.
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: But Ile be hanged if he weare your lyuery: Mary
go before into the field, and he may be your follower, so in
that sence your worship may call him man.
Tyb <i> (Tybalt) </i>: Romeo the hate I beare to thee can affoord no bet-
ter words then these, thou art a villaine.
Rom <i> (Romeo) </i>: Tybalt the lou(v)e I beare to thee, doth excuse the
appertaining rage to such a word: villaine am I none, ther(e)-
fore I well perceiu(v)e thou knowst me not.
Tyb <i> (Tybalt) </i>: Bace boy this cannot seru(v)e thy turne, and therefore
drawe.
Ro <i> (Romeo) </i>: I doe protest I neu(v)er inijured thee, but lou(v)e thee bet-
ter than thou canst deu(v)ise, till thou shalt know the reason of
my lou(v)e.
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: O dishonorable vile submission. Allastockado caries
it away. You Ratcatcher, come backe, come backe.
Tyb <i> (Tybalt) </i>: What wouldest with me?
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: Nothing King of Cates, but borrow one of your
nine liu(v)es, therefore come drawe your rapier out of your
scabard, least mine be about your eares ere you be aware.
Rom <i> (Romeo) </i>: Stay Ti(y)balt, hould Mercutio: Benu(v)olio beate
downe their weapons.
<b>Ti(y)balt under Romeo{‘}s arme thrusts Mer-
cutio, in and flyes.</b>
<b>(Exit Tybald)</b>
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: Is he gone,? h(H)ath hee nothing? A poxe on your
houses.
Rom <i> (Romeo) </i>: What art thou hurt man,(.) t(T)he wound is not deepe.
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: Noe not so deepe as a Well, nor so wide as a
barne doore, but it will seru(v)e I warrant. What meant you to
come betweene v(u)s? I was hurt v(u)nder your arme.
Rom <i> (Romeo) </i>: I did all for the best.
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: A poxe of your houses,(.) I am fairely drest. Sirra
goe fetch me a Surgeon.
Boy: I goe my Lord.
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: I am pepper(e)d for this world,(.) I am sped yfaith, he
hath made wormes meate of me, & (and) ye aske for me to (remove space)mor-
row you shall finde me a grau(v)e-man. A poxe of your houses,
I shall be fairely mounted v(u)pon foure men(‘)s shoulders: For
your house of the Mounte(a)gues and the Capo(u)lets: and then
some peasantly rogue, some Sexton, some base slave shall
write my Epitapth, that Tybalt came and broke the Prince(‘)s
Lawes,and Mercutio was slaine for the first and second
cause. Wher(e)'s the Surgeon?
Boy: Hee's come sir.
Mer <i> (Mercutio) </i>: Now heele keepe a mumbling in my guts on the
other side, come Benu(v)olio, lend me thy hand: a poxe of your
houses.
Exeunt
