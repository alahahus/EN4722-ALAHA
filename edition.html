<p>Enter Iuliet somewhat fast, and embraceth Romeo.</p>
<p>See where she comes.</p>
<p>So light of foote nere hurts the troden flower:</p>
<p>Of loue and ioy, see see the soueraigne power.</p>
<p>Iul: Romeo.</p>
<p>Rom: My Iuliet welcome. As doo waking eyes</p>
<p>(Cloasd in Nights mysts) attend the frolicke Day,</p>
<p>So Romeo hath expected Iuliet,</p>
<p>And thou art come.</p>
<p>Iul: I am (if I be Day)</p>
<p>Come to my Sunne: shine foorth, and make me faire.</p>
<p>Rom: All beauteous fairnes dwelleth in thine eyes.</p>
<p>Iul: Romeo from thine all brightnes doth arise.</p>
<p>Fr: Come wantons, come, the stealing houres do passe</p>
<p>Defer imbracements till some fitter time,</p>
<p>Part for a while, you shall not be alone,</p>
<p>Till holy Church haue ioynd ye both in one.</p>
<p>Rom: Lead holy Father, all delay seemes long.</p>
<p>Iul: Make hast, make hast, this lingring doth vs wrong.</p>
<p>Fr: O, soft and faire makes sweetest worke they say.</p>
<p>Hast is common hindrer in crosse way.</p>
<p>Exeunt omnes.</p>
<p>Enter Benuolio, Mercutio.</p>
<p>Ben: I pree thee good Mercutio lets retire,</p>
<p>The day is hot, the Capels are abroad.</p>
<p>Mer: Thou art like one of those, that when hee comes</p>
<p>into the confines of a tauerne, claps me his rapier on the</p>
<p>boord, and sayes, God send me no need of thee: and by</p>
<p>the operation of the next cup of wine, he drawes it on the</p>
<p>drawer, when indeed there is no need.</p>
<p>Ben: Am I like such a one?</p>
<p>Mer: Go too, thou art as hot a Iacke being mooude,</p>
<p>and as soone mooude to be moodie, and as soone moodie to</p>
<p>be mooud.</p>
<p>Ben: And what too?</p>
<p>Mer: Nay, and there were two such, wee should haue</p>
<p>none shortly. Didst not thou fall out with a man for crack-</p>
<p>ing of nuts, hauing no other reason, but because thou hadst</p>
<p>hasill eyes? what eye but such an eye would haue pickt out</p>
<p>such a quarrell? With another for coughing, because hee</p>
<p>wakd thy dogge that laye a sleepe in the Sunne ? With a</p>
<p>Taylor for wearing his new dublet before Easter: and</p>
<p>with another for tying his new shoes with olde ribands.</p>
<p>And yet thou wilt forbid me of quarrelling.</p>
<p>Ben: By my head heere comes a Capolet.</p>
<p>Enter Tybalt.</p>
<p>Mer: By my heele I care not.</p>
<p>Tyb: Gentlemen a word with one of you.</p>
<p>Mer: But one word with one of vs? You had best couple</p>
<p>it with somewhat,and make it a word and a blow.</p>
<p>Tyb: I am apt enough to that if I have occasion.</p>
<p>Mer: Could you not take occasion?</p>
<p>Tyb: Mercutio thou consorts with Romeo?</p>
<p>Mer: Consort Zwounes consort? the slave wil make fid-</p>
<p>lers of vs. If you doe sirra, look for nothing but discord: For</p>
<p>heeres my fiddle-sticke.</p>
<p>Enter Romeo.</p>
<p>Tyb: Well peace be with you, heere comes my man.</p>
<p>Mer: But Ile be hanged if he weare your lyuery: Mary</p>
<p>go before into the field, and he may be your follower, so in</p>
<p>that sence your worship may call him man.</p>
<p>Tyb: Romeo the hate I beare to thee can affoord no bet-</p>
<p>ter words then these, thou art a villaine.</p>
<p>Rom: Tybalt the loue I beare to thee, doth excuse the</p>
<p>appertaining rage to such a word: villaine am I none, ther-</p>
<p>fore I well perceiue thou knowst me not.</p>
<p>Tyb: Bace boy this cannot serue thy turne, and therefore</p>
<p>drawe.</p>
<p>Ro: I doe protest I neuer iniured thee, but loue thee bet-</p>
<p>ter than thou canst deuise, till thou shalt know the reason of</p>
<p>my loue.</p>
<p>Mer: O dishonorable vile submission. Allastockado caries</p>
<p>it away. You Ratcatcher, come backe, come backe.</p>
<p>Tyb: What wouldest with me?</p>
<p>Mer: Nothing King of Cates, but borrow one of your</p>
<p>nine liues, therefore come drawe your rapier out of your</p>
<p>scabard, least mine be about your eares ere you be aware.</p>
<p>Rom: Stay Tibalt, hould Mercutio: Benuolio beate</p>
<p>downe their weapons.</p>
<p>Tibalt under Romeos arme thrusts Mer-</p>
<p>cutio, in and flyes.</p>
<p>Mer: Is he gone, hath hee nothing? A poxe on your</p>
<p>houses.
<p>Rom: What art thou hurt man, the wound is not deepe.</p>
<p>Mer: Noe not so deepe as a Well, nor so wide as a</p>
<p>barne doore, but it will serue I warrant. What meant you to</p>
<p>come betweene vs? I was hurt vnder your arme.</p>
<p>Rom: I did all for the best.</p>
<p>Mer: A poxe of your houses, I am fairely drest. Sirra</p>
<p>goe fetch me a Surgeon.</p>
<p>Boy: I goe my Lord.</p>
<p>Mer: I am pepperd for this world, I am sped yfaith, he</p>
<p>hath made wormes meate of me, & ye aske for me to mor-</p>
<p>row you shall finde me a graue-man. A poxe of your houses,</p>
<p>I shall be fairely mounted vpon foure mens shoulders: For</p>
<p>your house of the Mountegues and the Capolets: and then</p>
<p>some peasantly rogue, some Sexton, some base slave shall</p>
<p>write my Epitapth, that Tybalt came and broke the Princes</p>
<p>Lawes,and Mercutio was slaine for the first and second</p>
<p>cause. Wher's the Surgeon?</p>
<p>Boy: Hee's come sir.</p>
<p>Mer: Now heele keepe a mumbling in my guts on the</p>
<p>other side, come Benuolio, lend me thy hand: a poxe of your</p>
<p>houses.</p>
<p>Exeunt</p>
