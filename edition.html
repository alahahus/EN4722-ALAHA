http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/doc/Rom_Q1/scene/2.6/ 
 
Enter Iuliet somewhat fast, and embraceth Romeo.
See where she comes.
So light of foote nere hurts the troden flower:
Of loue and ioy, see see the soueraigne power.
Iul: Romeo.
Rom: My Iuliet welcome. As doo waking eyes
(Cloasd in Nights mysts) attend the frolicke Day,
So Romeo hath expected Iuliet,
And thou art come.
Iul: I am (if I be Day)
Come to my Sunne: shine foorth, and make me faire.
Rom: All beauteous fairnes dwelleth in thine eyes.
Iul: Romeo from thine all brightnes doth arise.
Fr: Come wantons, come, the stealing houres do passe
Defer imbracements till some fitter time,
Part for a while, you shall not be alone,
Till holy Church haue ioynd ye both in one.
Rom: Lead holy Father, all delay seemes long.
Iul: Make hast, make hast, this lingring doth vs wrong.
Fr: O, soft and faire makes sweetest worke they say.
Hast is common hindrer in crosse way.
Exeunt omnes.
Enter Benuolio, Mercutio.
Ben: I pree thee good Mercutio lets retire,
The day is hot, the Capels are abroad.
Mer: Thou art like one of those, that when hee comes
into the confines of a tauerne, claps me his rapier on the
boord, and sayes, God send me no need of thee: and by
the operation of the next cup of wine, he drawes it on the
drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Ben: Am I like such a one?
Mer: Go too, thou art as hot a Iacke being mooude,
and as soone mooude to be moodie, and as soone moodie to
be mooud.
Ben: And what too?
Mer: Nay, and there were two such, wee should haue
none shortly. Didst not thou fall out with a man for crack-
ing of nuts, hauing no other reason, but because thou hadst
hasill eyes? what eye but such an eye would haue pickt out
such a quarrell? With another for coughing, because hee
wakd thy dogge that laye a sleepe in the Sunne ? With a
Taylor for wearing his new dublet before Easter: and
with another for tying his new shoes with olde ribands.
And yet thou wilt forbid me of quarrelling.
Ben: By my head heere comes a Capolet.
Enter Tybalt.
Mer: By my heele I care not.
Tyb: Gentlemen a word with one of you.
Mer: But one word with one of vs? You had best couple
it with somewhat,and make it a word and a blow.
Tyb: I am apt enough to that if I have occasion.
Mer: Could you not take occasion?
Tyb: Mercutio thou consorts with Romeo?
Mer: Consort Zwounes consort? the slave wil make fid-
lers of vs. If you doe sirra, look for nothing but discord: For
heeres my fiddle-sticke.
Enter Romeo.
Tyb: Well peace be with you, heere comes my man.
Mer: But Ile be hanged if he weare your lyuery: Mary
go before into the field, and he may be your follower, so in
that sence your worship may call him man.
Tyb: Romeo the hate I beare to thee can affoord no bet-
ter words then these, thou art a villaine.
Rom: Tybalt the loue I beare to thee, doth excuse the
appertaining rage to such a word: villaine am I none, ther-
fore I well perceiue thou knowst me not.
Tyb: Bace boy this cannot serue thy turne, and therefore
drawe.
Ro: I doe protest I neuer iniured thee, but loue thee bet-
ter than thou canst deuise, till thou shalt know the reason of
my loue.
Mer: O dishonorable vile submission. Allastockado caries
it away. You Ratcatcher, come backe, come backe.
Tyb: What wouldest with me?
Mer: Nothing King of Cates, but borrow one of your
nine liues, therefore come drawe your rapier out of your
scabard, least mine be about your eares ere you be aware.
Rom: Stay Tibalt, hould Mercutio: Benuolio beate
downe their weapons.
Tibalt under Romeos arme thrusts Mer-
cutio, in and flyes.
Mer: Is he gone, hath hee nothing? A poxe on your
houses.
Rom: What art thou hurt man, the wound is not deepe.
Mer: Noe not so deepe as a Well, nor so wide as a
barne doore, but it will serue I warrant. What meant you to
come betweene vs? I was hurt vnder your arme.
Rom: I did all for the best.
Mer: A poxe of your houses, I am fairely drest. Sirra
goe fetch me a Surgeon.
Boy: I goe my Lord.
Mer: I am pepperd for this world, I am sped yfaith, he
hath made wormes meate of me, & ye aske for me to mor-
row you shall finde me a graue-man. A poxe of your houses,
I shall be fairely mounted vpon foure mens shoulders: For
your house of the Mountegues and the Capolets: and then
some peasantly rogue, some Sexton, some base slave shall
write my Epitapth, that Tybalt came and broke the Princes
Lawes,and Mercutio was slaine for the first and second
cause. Wher's the Surgeon?
Boy: Hee's come sir.
Mer: Now heele keepe a mumbling in my guts on the
other side, come Benuolio, lend me thy hand: a poxe of your
houses.
Exeunt
