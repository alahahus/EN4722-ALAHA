<center><b>PEDDLER POLLY

<br>and Sold There</b></center>
<br>    
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   That was the sign on Peddler Polly’s cart as her horse pulled her up Main Street. Peddler Polly looked around and smiled.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   I’m sure glad to be back in Taletown. Imagine—a town where everyone tells stories!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   Peddler Polly parked at the town square. Over on Town Hall she saw a notice:</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>  </p>
<br>
<center><b>STORY SWAP TODAY
<br>Bring a story
<br>(if you still know one)</b></center>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   <b>(puzzled)</b> If you still know one?</p>
<br>
<p><b>PENNY:</b>   <b> (sadly)</b>  Hello, Peddler Polly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   . . . came a sad little girl’s voice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   Well, it’s my old friend Penny! Do you have a good story for me? I’ll gladly trade for something from my cart.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   Penny sobbed and sniffed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PENNY:</b>   I don’t have any stories at all! Hardly anyone in Taletown does. We’re all losing our stories!</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   Losing your stories? Whatever do you mean?</p>
<br>
<p><b>PENNY:</b>   We start to tell a story, and then it’s gone! We can’t remember it anymore. Come to the Story Swap this afternoon and see.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   <b>(loudly)</b> Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls . . .</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   Another cart had parked on the square. Its sign said,</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>  </p>
<br>
<center><b>DR. SEBASTIAN SPELLBINDER
<br>Entertainment Paraphernalia</b></center>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   In the cart stood a man with a topcoat, top hat, and goatee, surrounded by piles of wooden boxes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   A crowd was gathering before him.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>  You’ve heard of a story<i>teller.</i> And you’ve heard of a story<i>book.</i> Well, I’m here to show you something finer still: The brand-new, patented Spellbinder Storybox!</p>
<br>
<p><b>PENNY:</b>   </b> (delighted) </b> Oh, Peddler Polly! He’s selling <i>stories!</i></p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   Dr. Spellbinder held up one of the wooden boxes, showing a pane of glass on one side.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>   He flipped a switch and the glass came to life. Tiny characters moved across the pane, and tiny voices came out.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   Someone in the crowd yelled,</p>
<br>
<p><b>CROWD 1:</b>   It’s “Cinderella”!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>  Dr. Spellbinder turned a knob, and a different moving picture appeared.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CROWD 2:</b>   That’s “Puss in Boots”!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   He turned the knob again.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CROWD 3:</b>   And that’s “Sleeping Beauty”!</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   Never again will you have to ask for a story. And never again will you have to imagine the pictures! Who’ll be the first to buy a Spellbinder Storybox?</p>
<br>
<p><b>CROWD 1:</b>   I’ll take one!</p>
<br>
<p><b>CROWD 2:</b>   So will I!</p>
<br>
<p><b>CROWD 3:</b>   I’ll take two!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>   Before long, Dr. Spellbinder’s cart was empty. The town square was covered with children and grownups, all staring blankly at the little boxes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   <b>(to herself) </b>I don’t like the looks of this.</p>
<br>
		  <b><center>****</center></b>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   When Peddler Polly arrived at the Story Swap that afternoon, Town Hall was packed. The room was buzzing with talk about lost stories and Spellbinder Storyboxes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   Finally, Mayor Bertha Bigwig took the stage. She glanced nervously around her.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BERTHA BIGWIG:</b>  Welcome to the Story Swap. It is my honor to tell the first story: “The Pied Piper of Hamlin.”</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   From her seat by an open window, Peddler Polly heard a soft <i>whirr</i> and a sucking noise.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BERTHA BIGWIG:</b>   Life in the town of Hamlin was pleasant. Or it <i>would</i> have been, if not for the . . . the . . .</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>  The mayor turned pale.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BERTHA BIGWIG:</b>   I’ve lost my story!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>    . . . and she ran from the stage. A horrified murmur rose in the room.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   Milton Marbles, the schoolteacher, tried next.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MILTON MARBLES:</b>   My story is “Jack and the Beanstalk.”</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   Again Peddler Polly heard the <i>whirr</i> and the sucking.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MILTON MARBLES:</b>   There was once a poor widow who had an only son named . . . named . . . . Oh no!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>   He fled the stage in tears.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   Next came Penny.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PENNY:</b>   This is the myth of “Pegasus.”</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   Peddler Polly heard the noises once more.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PENNY:</b>   A long time ago in Greece, there was a horse called Pegasus. This horse was special because . . . because . . . because . . .</p>
<br>
<p><b>BERTHA BIGWIG:</b>   Stop the Swap! We can’t afford to lose any more stories. It’s the end of storytelling in Taletown!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   As excited talk filled the room, Peddler Polly thought she heard a cackle out the window.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>   She looked and saw a man with a topcoat and top hat hurry away from the building. He carried a large wooden box covered with switches, knobs, and dials, with a long hose attached to it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   It’s Dr. Spellbinder! I’d better look into this.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   Peddler Polly hastened from the hall. She followed Dr. Spellbinder from a distance as he left the town and made his way into the hills.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   At last Dr. Spellbinder disappeared through the mouth of a cave. Peddler Polly followed him in and stopped in astonishment. The huge cave was filled with mechanisms and contraptions, all of them noisily pulling or pushing or pulsing or pounding.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   Dr. Spellbinder stood at a workbench covered with Storyboxes and other strange devices. He set down the big box he was carrying and patted it fondly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   Three more stories to put in my Storyboxes! And all thanks to my brilliant invention, the Spellbinder Story Sucker. Soon I’ll steal all the stories in the world! Then <i>everyone</i> will need a Storybox, and I’ll be rich, <i>rich,</i> RICH.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>  Not if <b>I</b> can help it!</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   <b>(gasps) </b>Peddler Polly! What are <i>you</i> doing here?</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   Putting an end to your evil plans, Spellbinder!</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   You’ll never stop me, Peddler Polly!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>   Then Dr. Spellbinder grabbed the Story Sucker and sprinted from the cave.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   Down the hill sped Dr. Spellbinder, while Peddler Polly puffed in pursuit. Without the Story Sucker, Peddler Polly was faster.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   <b>(yelling back) </b>You won’t catch me so easily.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   He lifted the lid on the Story Sucker and reached in.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   See how you like <b>this</b> story, Peddler Polly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   He threw something behind him. There was a flash of light, and out of nowhere a huge crowd of children appeared, coming uphill toward Peddler Polly. They were led by a man in a many-colored costume, playing on a pipe.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   Well, I’ll be!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>   Peddler Polly pushed past the startled man and pressed through the crowd of mesmerized children.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   It’s a catchy tune, kids, but I wouldn’t follow a pied piper!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   Dr. Spellbinder was far ahead, but Peddler Polly ran hard and gained on him.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   <b>(calling back) </b>One good story deserves another!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>    . . . and he reached into the Story Sucker. Another flash, and Peddler Polly saw a boy chopping down a gigantic beanstalk. But just then the boy took to his heels, calling,</p>
<br>
<p><b>JACK:</b>   Heads up!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   Peddler Polly looked up and stopped just in time. A huge man tumbled from the sky and landed with an earth-shaking crash just before her.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   Didn’t know stories could be so dangerous.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>   Peddler Polly ran around the giant while she waved to the boy and called,</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   Thank you, Jack!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   Dr. Spellbinder had vanished behind a hill, and Peddler Polly panted after him. As she rounded the bend, she gasped.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   Tied to a landing platform was a lighter-than-air balloon, and Dr. Spellbinder was climbing into the basket.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   Oh, no! Now he’ll get away for sure! Unless . . . unless . . .</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   It’s all over now, Peddler Polly!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   Dr. Spellbinder untied the rope and the balloon floated into the air.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   But I still have one more story, and it might as well keep you busy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   <b>(to herself) </b>If it’s the one I <i>think</i> it is . . . .</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>   Dr. Spellbinder threw it to the ground. Another flash, and there stood a horse with long and graceful wings.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   Pegasus!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   Peddler Polly ran and leaped onto the horse, and dug in her heels.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   The horse flapped its wings smoothly and rose in the air. Up and up it spiraled, until it was flying circles around the dismayed Dr. Spellbinder.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   Guess you forgot your mythology, Spellbinder. Didn’t you know Pegasus was a <i>flying horse?</i></p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   Peddler Polly rode in close, grabbed Dr. Spellbinder, and flung him across the horse’s back.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPELLBINDER:</b>   My Story Sucker!</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>   . . . cried Dr. Spellbinder as the balloon floated away with his invention.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   I don’t guess you’ll need it where <i>you’re</i> going. For a crime like shutting up stories, a judge is sure to shut <i>you</i> up—unhappily ever after.</p>
<br>
			<b><center>* * *</center></b>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 1:</b>   A few weeks later, when all of Dr. Spellbinder’s Storyboxes had been opened and the stories returned to their tellers, the people of Taletown held a big storytelling festival on the town square. Mayor Bigwig announced,</p>
<br>
<p><b>BERTHA BIGWIG:</b>   And our special guest for today is Peddler Polly!</p>
<br>
<p><b>ALL</b>  (except PEDDLER POLLY and SPELLBINDER):  <b>(not in unison) </b>Hooray!</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEDDLER POLLY:</b>   Well, thanks. And now I’ll tell a story called “Peddler Polly and the Story Stealer.”</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 4:</b>   And that’s a tale</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 2:</b>   they’ll always tell</p>
<br>
<p><b>NARRATOR 3:</b>  in Taletown.</p>
